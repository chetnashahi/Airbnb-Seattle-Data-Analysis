# Airbnb-Seattle-Data-Analysis

Airbnb is most popular option for travelers as its very convenient and affordable. 

In this project, we will be analyzing Seattle property listings of the datasets downloaded from Kaggle. This project provides us with three datasets: Property Listings, Calendar & Reviews of Properties. I will be posting few business questions and will solve those questions with help of visualizations and data analysis.

Steps to proceed further:
- Clean dataset
- Solve few questions with visualizations
- Post the inferences wherever needed

Our analysis is to understand factors that influences pricings, doing deeper analysis to understand how holidays/days of week impact pricing. Below are few questions that will be discussed further:
- Which category of property tends to have higher cost?
- What is the occupancy rate in 2016 across months?
- What factors is price dependent on?
- Which time has the highest price?
- How does price fluctuate from weekdays versus weekends?
- Which holiday has the highest price rate?
