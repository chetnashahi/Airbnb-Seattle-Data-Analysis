# Airbnb-Seattle-Data-Analysis

Airbnb is most popular option for travelers as its very convenient and affordable. 

In this project, we will be analyzing Seattle property listings of the datasets downloaded from Kaggle. This project provides us with three datasets: Property Listings, Calendar & Reviews of Properties. I will be posting few business questions and will solve those questions with help of visualizations and data analysis.

Steps to proceed further:
- Clean dataset
- Solve few questions with visualizations
- Post the inferences wherever needed

Our analysis is to understand factors that influences pricings, doing deeper analysis to understand how holidays/days of week impact pricing. Below are few questions that will be discussed further:
- Which category of property tends to have higher cost?
- What is the occupancy rate in 2016 across months?
- What factors is price dependent on?
- Which time has the highest price?
- How does price fluctuate from weekdays versus weekends?
- Which holiday has the highest price rate?

## Summary
Based on our analysis so far we conclude that July month sees the highest price while Jan has the lowest dip. After doing a deep dive into it, we understand 4th July has the highest pricing compared to all the other holidays, owing to Independence Day. Boat is one of the most expensive properties offerings. Weekends also sees higher prices compared to weekdays and more the number of beds, bedrooms, bathrooms, higher the price goes. Now when you plan the next trip, you can take above factors into consideration to get the best bet.

## Future Scope of Work
I will be working on building price prediction model on this dataset using some key features only. We will also be cominging Boston Airbnb dataset to this.
